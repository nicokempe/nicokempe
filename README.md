I am a German **hobby programmer** who enjoys getting to know new technologies in his spare time and working with them in both small and larger projects.
To get to know me a little better, here are some facts about me: 
- In between my many small projects, I mainly work on a currently still secret project called **[Project: Dynasty](https://www.github.com/project-dynasty)**.
- Outside of my free time, I am currently in 12th grade at a business vocational school in NÃ¼rtingen. (**[Schulwerk Mitte](https://schulwerk-mitte.de/)**)
- In addition to developing software, I am interested in **politics** and **history**.

## Here are some technologies i like to work with:
Of course, I am not completely familiar with each of the following technologies, but I have usually worked with most of them for at least weeks and was able to gain a first impression of them. I use other technologies such as Unity more often.
